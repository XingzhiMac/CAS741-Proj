RSSC does not require installation. 

To use RSSC, you can simply run RSSC.py and follow the instructions to enter your file names.

You should put your input files in the "input" folder under this directory. 

RSSC will generate the output file in the "output" folder under this directory.

To run RSSC, you need to provide 3 text files in the input folder: a tsm file, an sp file, and a wall file. 
You can name them whatever you like, but you should always be clear about which filename corresponding 
to which file.

For example, you can name your tsm file as "tsm.txt", sp file as "sp_1.txt", and wall file as "MywAlL.txt".
When you use RSSC, you shall not enter "sp_1.txt" for the tsm file, otherwise unpredictable errors will occur.

In the tsm file, you shall put your transmitter's 2-D location in the first line, the transmitter's power level
in the second line, and signal frequency in the third line.

You shall put the 2-D locations of your sampling points in the sp file, each line should be one location.

In the wall file you are going to provide information for each and every wall in the building/simulation area.
Each line should contain the following 6 data separated by commas: 
- X-coordinate of the wall's first end;
- Y-coordinate of the wall's first end;
- X-coordinate of the wall's second end;
- Y-coordinate of the wall's second end;
- Transmittance of the wall;
- Reflectance of the wall.

The output file contains the estimated received signal strengths for the sampling points. In each line you may
find a 2-D location with a number. the 2-D location is from the sampling point in your input sp file, and the number
is the estimated received signal strength in (dBm) at that sampling point.

I provided a examples for each file in the input and output folder, which may be helpful.

Good luck!
