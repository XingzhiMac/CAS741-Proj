This document records and presents the verification and validation plan for RSSC
to help ensure the program meets the requirements. General information including
a quick recall of RSSC's background is given in \autoref{GeneralInfo}. 
\autoref{plan} provides a plan for verification and \autoref{systd} describes 
the system tests, including tests for functional requirements and tests for non-
functional requirements.


\section{General Information}
\label{GeneralInfo}

\subsection{Summary}

The software to test is Radio Signal Strength Calculator (RSSC). The purpose of
RSSC is to simulate the radio signal propagation in the indoor environment defined
by the user, and find the analytical signal strength for the user. 

\subsection{Objectives}

The objective of this document is to build confidence in the software correctness.
To reach this objective, all functional and non-functional requirements will be
tested following the descriptions in this document.

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

SRS will be done by team members reviewing the document. Team members can put
any comments, suggestions or questions in RSSC's Github repository as issues.
The author will respond to the issues and make modifications when needed.

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

Design verification will be done by team members, by reviewing whether the steps 
of calculation in the software follows the physical model in SRS or not. 

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

Implementation verification will be done by testing all the functional and non-
functional requirements. Descriptions of the tests can be found in \autoref{tfr} and \autoref{tnfr}. In addition, we will undergo static verification by checking
all the codes we build with Pylint. We will also conduct unit testing for modules
within the testing scope. Details for unit testing can be found in \autoref{unittest}.


\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Python Unittest
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Pylint
\end{itemize}
\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

There are no plans for validation. We may be able to set up a simulation of radio
frequency signal on existing physics simulation tools and take the simulation 
result as a reference to evaluate RSSC's output, but different tools makes 
different assumptions to the indoor signal propagation model and we cannot 
change their assumptions. It is highly unlikely that we could find a tool 
that makes the same assumptions as RSSC. Therefore we do not have any reference 
to evaluate RSSC's correctness.


\section{System Test Description}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}
\label{tfr}

Functional requirements for RSSC are given in 
\href{https://github.com/XingzhiMac/CAS741-Proj/blob/master/docs/SRS/SRS.pdf}
{SRS} section 5.1. There are 5 functional requirements for RSSC, from R1 to R5.
R1 and R2 are corresponding to inputs, while R3 to R5 are corresponding to outputs.
\autoref{area1} describes the input tests for R1 and R2; and \autoref{area2} 
describes the output tests for R3, R4 and R5.

\section{Unit Test Description}
\label{unittest}

\wss{Reference your MIS and explain your overall philosophy for test case
  selection.}  
\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS has
  been completed.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\begin{enumerate}

  be automatic}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}
