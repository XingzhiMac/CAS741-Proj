This document records and presents the verification and validation plan for RSSC
to help ensure the program meets the requirements. General information including
a quick recall of RSSC's background is given in \autoref{GeneralInfo}. 
\autoref{plan} provides a plan for verification and \autoref{systd} describes 
the system tests, including tests for functional requirements and tests for non-
functional requirements.


\section{General Information}
\label{GeneralInfo}

\subsection{Summary}

The software to test is Radio Signal Strength Calculator (RSSC). The purpose of
RSSC is to simulate the radio signal propagation in the indoor environment defined
by the user, and find the analytical signal strength for the user. 

\subsection{Objectives}

The objective of this document is to build confidence in the software correctness.
To reach this objective, all functional and non-functional requirements will be
tested following the descriptions in this document.

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

SRS will be done by team members reviewing the document. Team members can put
any comments, suggestions or questions in RSSC's Github repository as issues. The
SRS reviewing team includes the following members: domain expert Siddharth (Sid) Shinde, 
the SRS reviewer Leila Mousapour, Dr. Spencer Smith, and the author Xingzhi Liu.
The author will respond to the issues and make modifications when needed.

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

Design verification will be done by team members, by reviewing whether the steps 
of calculation in the software follows the physical model in SRS or not. 

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

Implementation verification will be done by testing all the functional and non-functional requirements. Descriptions of the tests can be found in \autoref{tfr} and \autoref{tnfr}. 
In addition, we will undergo static verification by checking
all the codes we build with Pylint. We will also conduct unit testing for modules
within the testing scope. Details for unit testing can be found in \autoref{unittest}.


\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Python Unittest
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Pylint
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

There are no plans for validation. We may be able to set up a simulation of radio
frequency signal on existing physics simulation tools and take the simulation 
result as a reference to evaluate RSSC's output, but different tools makes 
different assumptions to the indoor signal propagation model and we cannot 
change their assumptions. It is highly unlikely that we could find a tool 
that makes the same assumptions as RSSC. Therefore we do not have any reference 
to evaluate RSSC's correctness.

\section{Unit Test Description}
\label{unittest}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

We will conduct unit testings for the following modules:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Point
	\item Wall
	\item Linear Path
	\item Intersection
	\item Linear Path Loss
	\item Specular Reflection
\end{itemize}
Modules including Control, Input Parameters, Output, and Floor Map have low priorities for
verification than others because their correctness can be adequately proven by 
\nameref{area1} and \nameref{area2}.\\
Module Received Signal Strength only contains some basic numerical calculations so
we do not need to test it separately. \nameref{area2} will be sufficient to verify its functionality.\\
Module Line-Of-Sight Signal and module First-Order Reflection Signal require module Input Parameters to run first before they work, and cannot be verified separately. However, testings in \nameref{area2} requires these two modules working properly to provide outputs. Therefore, these two modules will be verified by \nameref{area2}.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{lp-1\\}

Type: manual

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Uint}
\label{intersection}

This section tests the functionality of Intersection module in finding the position and validity of the potential intersection point of any two line segments given.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{inter-1\\}

Type: manual
					
Initial State: none
					
Input: \\
seg1 = output of test case wall-1 in \nameref{wall};\\
seg2 = output of test case lp-1 in \nameref{LP};\\
					
Output: \\
Intersection position = (0.2, 2.0)\\
validity = 1\\

Test Case Derivation: seg1 is a line segment from (0, 0) to (1, 10); seg2 is a line segment from (-2, 2) to (13, 2). Both of them cross the point (0.2, 2.0), therefore (0.2, 2.0) is a valid intersection of seg1 and seg2.\\

How test will be performed: Call Intersection.find$\_$intersection(seg1, seg2) and print the result
as well as the expected result. Then Call Intersection.is$\_$valid(seg1, seg2) and print the result
as well as the expected result.

\item{inter-2\\}

Type: manual
					
Initial State: none
					
Input: \\
seg1 = output of test case wall-4 in \nameref{wall};\\
seg2 = output of test case lp-3 in \nameref{LP};\\
					
Output: \\
Intersection position = (not important)\\
validity = 0\\

Test Case Derivation: seg1 is a line segment from (3, 4) to (3, 0); seg2 is a line segment from (-2, 2) to (-2, 10). seg1 and seg2 are parallel, so they do not have intersection points. Therefore the validity is 0 and the position of the potential intersection point is unessential.\\

How test will be performed: Call Intersection.find$\_$intersection(seg1, seg2) and print the result
as well as the expected result. Then Call Intersection.is$\_$valid(seg1, seg2) and print the result
as well as the expected result.

\item{inter-3\\}

Type: manual
					
Initial State: none
					
Input: \\
seg1 = output of test case wall-3 in \nameref{wall};\\
seg2 = output of test case lp-3 in \nameref{LP};\\
					
Output: \\
Intersection position = (-2, -2.667)(not important)\\
validity = 0\\

Test Case Derivation: seg1 is a line segment from (0, 0) to (3, 4); seg2 is a line segment from (-2, 2) to (-2, 10). extension lines of the two segments intersect at (-2, -2.667), but the two line segments do not cross that point. Therefore the potential intersection point is invalid.\\

How test will be performed: Call Intersection.find$\_$intersection(seg1, seg2) and print the result
as well as the expected result. Then Call Intersection.is$\_$valid(seg1, seg2) and print the result
as well as the expected result.
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Ull}
\label{ll}

This section tests the functionality of Linear Path Loss module to determine the power loss of a signal along a given linear path.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{ll-1\\}

Type: manual
					
Initial State: none
					
Input: \\
path1 = output of test case lp-1 in \nameref{LP};\\
frequency = $2.48\times10^9$;\\
floor$\_$map = a FloorMap object with the following3 walls:\\
\indent wall1 = output of test case wall-1 in \nameref{wall};\\
\indent wall2 = output of test case wall-2 in \nameref{wall};\\
\indent wall2 = output of test case wall-3 in \nameref{wall};\\
					
Output: linear path loss = $4.1185\times10^-09$.\\

Test Case Derivation: The linear path loss is calculated with the Line Of Sight Signal Strength model described in SRS.\\

How test will be performed: Call function LinearLoss.find$\_$linear$\_$path$\_$loss(path1, frequency, floor$\_$map) and print the result as well as the expected result.
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Uspec}
\label{specular}

This section tests the functionality of Specular Reflection in finding the validity and potential path of a potential first-order reflected signal.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{spec-1\\}

Type: manual
					
Initial State: none
					
Input: \\
wall = output of test case wall-1 in \nameref{wall};\\
start = Point(-2, 2);\\
end = Point(-1, 3);\\
					
Output: \\
first half of the signal path (path1) = a path from Point(-2, 2) to Point(0.01884, 0.1884)\\
first half of the signal path (path1) = a path from Point(0.01884, 0.1884) to Point(-1, 3)\\
validity = 1\\

Test Case Derivation: the reflected image of the start point (-2, 2) against the given wall is at (2.3564, 1.5644). The virtual signal path from the reflected image of the starting point to the ending point intersects the wall at Point(0.1782, 1.782), which is a valid intersection. These information implies the existence of a first-order reflected signal from Point(-2, 2) to Point(-1, 3), reflected by the input wall at Point(0.1782, 1.782). The module's task is to find such a signal.\\

How test will be performed: Call Specular.get$\_$mirrored$\_$paths(wall, start, end)) and print the output as well as the expected results.

Test Case Derivation: the reflected image of the start point (-2, 2) against the given wall is at (8.2, 5.4). The virtual signal path from the reflected image of the starting point to the ending point is supposed to intersect the wall at Point(3.1, 3.7), but this is not a valid intersection. These information implies that there is no first-order reflected signals from Point(-2, 2) to Point(-1, 3).\\

How test will be performed: Call Specular.get$\_$mirrored$\_$paths(wall, start, end)) and print the output as well as the expected results.
